# SPE CMS and API (adapted from CMS project brief)
### Vision
A simple content management system that contains project data such as:
 - client name
 - client contact
 - project title 
 - project brief
 - group members 
 - and GitHub repository URL

The CMS will provide an API to other services for reading and writing data.

### Motivation
The CMS will be the foundation for new tooling; this tooling will ultimately provide up-to-date insight into the progress of the University of Bristol SPE groups

This will be done via MS Teams and other tools.

The CMS will be read by the GitHub Analytics client via an API that will provide GitHub data to MS Teams
