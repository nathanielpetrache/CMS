# SPE Content Management System (CMS)

### Vision
We aim to provide a simple content management system for managing projects in the University of Bristol Department of Computer Science Software Engineering Project unit.

It will contain project data such as:
 - project title 
 - project brief
 - client name
 - client contact
 - and GitHub repository URL

The CMS will provide an API to other services for reading data.

### Motivation
The CMS will be the foundation for new tooling; this tooling will ultimately provide up-to-date insight into the progress of the University of Bristol Computer Science SPE groups.
