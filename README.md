# SPE Content Management System (CMS)

### Vision
A simple content management system that contains project data such as:
 - client name
 - client contact
 - project title 
 - project brief
 - and GitHub repository URL

The CMS will provide an API to other services for reading data.

### Motivation
The CMS will be the foundation for new tooling; this tooling will ultimately provide up-to-date insight into the progress of the University of Bristol SPE groups.
